First Feedback Session with Client :

//A. Change navbar item color from blue to red or some grey.
B. Simplyfy the recipes, dont have seperate sections for each type
   at least for now but perhaps re-instate one day when there is more content.
// C. Change ABOUT page to be more like iPhone page.

Second feedback session : 
// Client happy with the mobile approach to the About section, so will be applying the same structure to the other sections.
Client is planning on getting some more professional photos taken that they will then provide to us for the final site.
